# Stothramala - the garland of beautiful song-like verses
Ok, well this repo is not all about songs / vedic-heritage / indic languages.

This is my attempt to bring Indic-language transliteration code to the .NET platform.

And, based on this, work on adding more. Specifically, working towards a telegram bot that helps in bringing indic-knowlege on the internet in the form accessible to us on fingertips.

# The idea
The simple idea goes like this: the user of the bot is able to search for information using english / other roman scheme languages, and the bot gets the information, although the original knowledge is in an indian language.

# Use-case, and a story line
```
Ramesh: Get me a verse that starts with "Karmananye vaadhika raste..."
Bot: Oh, yes! Here it is in "devanagari":
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥
Bot: Do you also want to read it in Sanskritised english (IAST)?
Ramesh: Yes!
Bot: Ok, here it is:
karmaṇyēvādhikārastē mā phalēṣu kadāchana ।
mā karmaphalahēturbhūrmā tē saṅgōstvakarmaṇi ||
Bot: Feel free to ask me the same in any other Indian language...
